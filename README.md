Variables & data types

Operators (arithmetic, precedence, increment/decrement)

Control structures (if, else, switch, logical operators)

Loops (for, while, foreach)

Arrays (indexed, associative, array functions)

Forms ($_GET, $_POST)

Input handling (isset(), empty())

Radio buttons & checkboxes

Functions (custom function definitions)

String functions (strtoupper, etc.)

Math functions (pow, pi, rand, max, etc.)

Validation & sanitization (filter_input)

Include files (include())

Cookies (setcookie)

Sessions (not fully implemented but noted)
